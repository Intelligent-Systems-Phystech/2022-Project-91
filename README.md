## Аннотация
Initial paper analyses the periodic signals in the time series to recognize human activity by using a mobile accelerometer. Each point in the timeline corresponds to a segment of historical time series. This segments form a phase trajectory in phase space of human activity. The principal components of segments of the phase trajectory are treated as feature descriptions at the point in the timeline. The purpose of this work collect some new data, and try "довести до ума" original paper.
